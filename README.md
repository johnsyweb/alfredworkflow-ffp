# Alfred Workflow for switching profiles in Firefox

## Description
This Alfred workflow lets you select any Firefox profiles found in `~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox/Profiles/`. It lets you open different FF profiles in parallel. Its written in Ruby which I never worked with before. I Think there are better ways to do it. Anyways, I am using it on a daily base.

## Installing
1. Click the download button to the right
2. Double-click to import into Alfred 2
3. Review the workflow to add custom Hotkeys

## Todo
* Add option to quit other FF instances
* Add option to switch between profiles in Google Chrome
* Clean up code ;)
